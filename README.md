# My Portfolio Website

First off, credit where credit is due, I cloned the template for this website from Ram Maheshwari (<a href=https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio>rammcodes</a>). I've made quite a lot of changes, but the general framework and style of the site are his. The original site he designed can be viewed <a href="https://dopefolio.netlify.app/">here</a>.

My site is hosted on Amazon's S3 servers, which turn out to be shockingly affordable! You can see it at <a href="calebsavard.com">calebsavard.com</a>. I'm no web developer, so any feedback is welcome!
