# My Portfolio Website

First off, credit where credit is due, I cloned the template for this website from Ram Maheshwari (<a href=https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio>rammcodes</a>). I've made quite a lot of changes, but the general framework and style of the site are his. The original site he designed can be viewed <a href="https://dopefolio.netlify.app/">here</a>.
